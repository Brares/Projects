Hello and Welcome to My Sliding Tiles Solver

To run the program, just type 'make' in the terminal. The make file should compile the program. Once it finishes to compile. 
Type './Test' and the program should run. Remember capital T in ./Test

Once you finish testing the program, you can run 'make clean' and all the unwanted files will be deleted.

The Program should be running okay. Just make sure that the configuration that you enter is solvable. Otherwise, it would run until run out of memory.

THANKS
