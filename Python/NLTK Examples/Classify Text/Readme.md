Using the Brown corpus, the program classifies texts according to one of the categories/
genres, and evaluate the results. It uses Word2Vec to represent the words, and the two following classifiers:

(a) Logistic regression or single-layer perceptron, and
(b) Multi-layer neural network (about 3 or 5 layers with 2 or 3 units each).

The data is splited into training and testing (e.g., 90% and 10%).

It needs Anaconda and Python 3.6
